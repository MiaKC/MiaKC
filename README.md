**ABOUT ME**

I am a programmer with 4 years of experience in various languages.
I have entry-level skills in Python, C, and C++.

I am currently focused on learning web development using Odin Project. 
My goal is to demonstrate web development skills through my own website, and become qualified for web development jobs.

I am a hobbyist game developer, working in Godot Engine with GDscript. My current game development project is an untitled business simulator about making and selling jams. I have a few finished games, but I hope to make this one the first that is worthy of publishing.

In my free time I am also a musician and songwriter. I play guitar, bass, assorted string instruments, keyboards, drums/percussion, and vocals
